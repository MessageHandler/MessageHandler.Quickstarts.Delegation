# Implementing a delegation

This project is part of the [MessageHandler processing patterns](https://www.messagehandler.net/patterns/) library.

## What is a delegation

A delegation responds to a command by invoking another command.

## When to use it

Use this pattern every time something needs to happen in another location.

## Scenario

The scenario for this quickstart is a command to notify an e-commerce buyer through email, but it is delegated from an API to a Worker and in turn again to a specialized email service.

## What you need to get started

- The [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) should be installed
- The sample was created using [Visual Studio 2022 community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
- To receive events an [azure service bus namespace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-create-namespace-portal) is used.
- The **MessageHandler.Runtime.AtomicProcessing** package is available from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MessageHandler.Runtime.AtomicProcessing/)

## Running the sample

Prior to being able to run the sample, you need to [configure the user secrets file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows#manage-user-secrets-with-visual-studio).

In the secrets file you must specify the following configuration values.

```JSON
{
  "servicebusnamespace": "your azure service bus connection string goes here"
}
```

Also ensure a queue named `emails` is created up front in the service bus namespace.

Once configured you can start the worker or run the unittests.

## Designed with testing in mind

MessageHandler is intented to be test friendly.

This sample contains plenty of ideas on how to test a delegation without requiring a dependency on an actual broker instance, and thus keep the tests fast.

- [Component tests](https://github.com/MessageHandler/MessageHandler.Quickstarts.Delegation/tree/master/src/Tests/ComponentTests): To test the delegation logic and it's interaction with the email service.
- [Contract tests](https://github.com/MessageHandler/MessageHandler.Quickstarts.Delegation/tree/master/src/Tests/ContractTests): To verify that the test doubles used in the component tests are behaving the same as an actual dependency would. Note: contract verification files are often shared between producers and consumers of the contract.
